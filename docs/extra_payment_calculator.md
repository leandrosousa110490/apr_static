# Extra Payment Calculator

The Extra Payment Calculator is a powerful tool that helps you see how making additional payments on your loan can save you money and time.

## Features

### 1. Payment Schedule Options
- **Monthly (Standard)**: Regular monthly payments

### 2. Extra Payment Options
- **Extra Monthly Payment**: Add this amount to every regular monthly payment
- **Extra Annual Payment**: Make an additional lump sum payment once per year
- **One-Time Extra Payment**: Make a single additional payment at a specific month

### 3. Visualizations & Results
- **Interactive Timeline Chart**: See how your loan balance decreases over time with extra payments compared to the standard schedule
- **Savings Summary**: See exactly how much interest you'll save and how many years/months earlier you'll pay off your loan
- **Progress Bar**: Visualize your interest savings as a percentage of the total interest
- **Detailed Amortization Schedule**: View a month-by-month breakdown of payments, showing exactly how each extra payment affects your loan balance

2. Check the "Include extra payments" checkbox
3. Choose your payment schedule (Monthly or Bi-Weekly)
4. Enter any extra payments you want to make

## Tips for Maximum Savings

- **Bi-weekly payments** are one of the simplest ways to pay off a loan faster without feeling a significant impact on your budget
- Making **extra payments early** in your loan term saves more interest than later payments
- Even **small extra payments** ($50-100 per month) can lead to significant savings over the life of a loan
- Consider applying **tax refunds or bonuses** as annual extra payments
- The **one-time payment** option is great for simulating the effect of a windfall or inheritance
